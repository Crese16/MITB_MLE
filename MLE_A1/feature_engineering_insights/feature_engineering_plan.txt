FEATURE ENGINEERING IMPLEMENTATION PLAN
==================================================

IMMEDIATE IMPLEMENTATION:
1. Financial Ratios:
   - debt_to_income = loan_amt / Annual_Income
   - emi_burden = Total_EMI_per_month / Monthly_Inhand_Salary
   - debt_service_ratio = Outstanding_Debt / Annual_Income

2. Behavioral Features:
   - total_engagement = sum(all_clickstream_features)
   - activity_diversity = count(non_zero_clickstream)

3. Customer Segmentation:
   - age_bins = categorize Age into groups
   - income_categories = categorize Annual_Income

RECOMMENDED FEATURE TRANSFORMATIONS:
- Log transform: loan_amt, Annual_Income (if skewed)
- Standardize: all numerical features before modeling
- One-hot encode: Occupation, other categorical variables
